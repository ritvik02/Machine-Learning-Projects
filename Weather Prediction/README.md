# [Image classifier using custom dataset](https://github.com/dipam7/fastai/blob/master/deep_learning/course1/lesson2/custom_dataset_classifier.ipynb)

Creating an image classifier is cool, but creating one with your own dataset is cooler! With this project you can create 
your own classifier by downloading data from [google images](https://images.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl) or training a model 
using images from your own gallery. I have made a peppa pig classifier for my niece using a pretrained model.

In this notebook we experiment with optimization of deep learning algorithms and the effects of extremely high or 
extremely low learning rates. [Article](https://medium.com/@dipam44/learning-rate-and-golf-87c8d4697e31) related to this notebook.
