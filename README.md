## [Machine Learning vs Deep Learning on Tabular Data](https://github.com/ritvik02/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20vs%20Deep%20Learning%20on%20Tabular%20Data)
Early on there was a lot of skepticism regarding the use of neural networks for tabular data. This short experiment compares the 2 approaches and finds out if deep learning models can match the performance of machine learning models in case of tabular data. Results below:
